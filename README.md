[![GitHub][github_badge]][github_link] [![PyPI][pypi_badge]][pypi_link]

Streamlit components that adds the ability to draw chemical compounds. This is a critical dependency for most drug discovery / drug design / cheminformatics applications.

It is based on [Ketcher](https://lifescience.opensource.epam.com/ketcher/index.html).

## Installation

```shell
pip install streamlit-ketcher
```

## Getting started

```python
import streamlit as st

from streamlit_ketcher import st_ketcher

molecule = st.text_input("Molecule", "CCO")
smile_code = st_ketcher(molecule)
st.markdown(f"Smile code: ``{smile_code}``")
```

## Development Notes

To setup the dev server, `cd frontend` and run `yarn install --frozen-lockfile` to reproduce the dev environment exactly. Then run `yarn start` to start a local server.

Simple unit tests can be run with `pytest tests/`.

To install in editable mode locally (to run integration tests), `cd frontend` and run `yarn build` before running `pip install -e .` Integration tests also require setting up `playwright` (installed from `dev-requirements.txt`). Install browsers with `playwright install` after pip reqs are downloaded. Afterwards, run `pytest e2e/`.
